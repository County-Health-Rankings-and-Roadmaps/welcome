Welcome to the **County Health Open Source Project**, a community-driven effort to preserve, update, and extend the **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps** data after the loss of program funding.

For the past fifteen years (2010-2025), County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) has drawn attention to why there are differences in health within and across communities. 
The program highlights policies and practices that can help everyone be as healthy as possible. 
CHR&R aims to grow a shared understanding of health, equity and the power of communities to improve health for all. 
This work is rooted in a long-term vision where all people and places have what they need to thrive.  

CHR&R is committed to creating resources and tools that support community-led efforts to accurately diagnose core problems, 
understand and account for historical context and implement evidence-informed solutions. 
CHR&R provides a snapshot of the health of nearly every county in the nation.  

Our mission is to:

-   Keep 15+ years of county health data accessible
-   Enable anyone with interest or expertise to contribute new calculations
-   Support transparent, open methods
-   Provide user-friendly ways to explore county-level health data
