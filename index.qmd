Welcome to the **County Health Open-Source Project (CHOP)**, a community-driven effort to preserve, update, and extend the **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R)** data after the program concludes in December 2026. For more than a decade, CHR&R has helped communities understand the factors that shape health and equity. This project ensures that its data, methods, and tools remain accessible long into the future. 

Our mission is to: 

-   Keep 15+ years of county health data accessible 
-   Provide user-friendly ways to explore county-level health information 
-   Support transparent, open methods and reproducible workflows 
-   Build a community-based effort to continue producing CHRR measures beyond 2026 

Beginning in March 2026, [**The CHR&R Archives**](https://county-health-rankings-and-roadmaps.github.io/welcome/archives.html) will be available to current CHR&R data users including:

-   CHR&R datasets from 2010 through 2025
-   A repository of code used to calculate CHR&R measures
-   Methods, source documentation, data tools, and more

New features to be finalized throughout 2026 include:

-   [**County Health Snapshots**](https://countyhealthrankings.shinyapps.io/snapshot/)
    -   This interactive app is currently in development. It is useful for viewing and downloading state-and county-level data for measures of Population Health and Well-being and Community Conditions based on the [UWPHI model of health](https://uwphi.pophealth.wisc.edu/chrr/). County health snapshots facilitate quick viewing of health measures without requiring data or programming expertise.
-   [**County Health Open-source Community**](https://county-health-rankings-and-roadmaps.github.io/welcome/community.html)
    -   A community-driven effort to extend CHR&R data into 2027 and beyond. See our About page to learn more.
