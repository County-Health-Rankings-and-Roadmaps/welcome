Welcome to the **County Health Open-Source Project (CHOP)**, a community-driven effort to preserve, update, and extend the **County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R)** data after the program concludes in December 2026. For more than a decade, CHR&R has helped communities understand the factors that shape health and equity. This project ensures that its data, methods, and tools remain accessible. 

## Our Mission

-   Keep 15+ years of county health data accessible 
-   Provide user-friendly ways to explore county-level information on health and the conditions that shape health 
-   Support transparent, open methods and reproducible workflows 
-   Build a community-based effort to continue producing CHR&R measures beyond 2026 

## Data Availability

Beginning in March 2026, [**The CHR&R Archives**](https://county-health-rankings-and-roadmaps.github.io/welcome/archives.html) will include:

-   CHR&R datasets from 2010 through 2025
-   A repository of code used to calculate CHR&R measures
-   Methods, source documentation, data tools, and more

## New Features 

Additional tools to be finalized throughout 2026 include:

-   [**County Health Snapshots**](https://countyhealthrankings.shinyapps.io/snapshot/)
    -   A user-friendly dashboard to view and download state and county-level data produced by CHR&R
-   [**County Health Open-source Community**](https://county-health-rankings-and-roadmaps.github.io/welcome/community.html)
    -   A community-driven effort to extend CHR&R data into 2027 and beyond. See our [Contribution Guidelines](https://county-health-rankings-and-roadmaps.github.io/welcome/contribute.html) to learn more.

[Countyhealthrankings.org](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) will be available through December 2026. We encourage users to download datasets and technical documentation available on our website before the end of the year. This page will be updated regularly with additional resources.

These resources have been developed and curated by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps team members.
