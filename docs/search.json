The program highlights policies and practices that can help everyone be as healthy as possible. CHR&R aims to grow a shared understanding of health, equity and the power of communities to improve health for all. This work is rooted in a long-term vision where all people and places have what they need to thrive.\nFollowing funding loss, the mission of the County Health Open-Source Project is to:"

To check out fifteen years of CHR&R history, visit our archives:\nData Archives (Zenodo): Versioned releases of CHR&R datasets for each year (2010–2025), each with a DOI for citation and direct download. There are two primary Zenodo repositories: one contains human-readable Excel files, designed for quick inspection and use by non-technical users, and the other contains relational files with metadata, which are most useful for analysts. The relational files serve as the backbone of the countyhealthR package and the County Snapshot app.\nMethods and Source Documentation Archives (LINK COMING SOON): Static archive of measure definitions, source descriptions, and calculation notes from past releases. Use this to understand how measures were historically calculated.\nPublications and White Papers (LINK COMING SOON): Past technical reports and methods papers describing the CHR&R model, measures, and methods.\nWhat Works for Health Archives (LINK COMING SOON): Curated, evidence-informed summaries of policies, programs, and strategies shown to improve health and equity, last updated in 2025."
