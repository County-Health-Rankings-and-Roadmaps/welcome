#### COMING SUMMER 2026

### **WHO**

Researchers, public health practitioners, data analysts, and anyone who uses county-level health data for research, policy, or community impact. If you care about transparent, reproducible, and accessible public health data, we invite you to join our community.

### **WHAT**

The **CHR&R Open-source Project** is a collaborative space where users can access validated code, methods, and inputs to calculate, update, and extend county-level health measures. Community members have access to:

-   Documented workflows for reproducible analysis
-   A Discussion Forum for questions and troubleshooting
-   A Show and Tell space to share successes, lessons, and analyses

We encourage public sharing, reuse, and adaptation of derivative data products and tools. Whether you’re reproducing existing measures, refreshing them for new years, or building entirely new analyses, this is a place to learn and build together.

### **WHEN**

The project is expected to be fully launched by Summer 2026, and the community will continue to grow and evolve as new health datasets become available.

### **WHERE**

All of our code, discussion forums, and resources live on GitHub, so anyone can access, use, and build on them from anywhere in the world.

### **WHY**

Users of CHR&R data have consistently expressed the importance of keeping these data accessible and usable for research, policy, and community decision-making. By making tools, code, and workflows open-source, we ensure county-level health data remain transparent, reproducible, and alive for current and future use. Our goal is to empower the community to continue producing, updating, and extending these important measures independently.
