County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R) served as a trusted national resource for understanding what shapes health and equity across U.S. communities. CHR&R data helped local leaders, researchers, and residents explore how where we live, learn, work, and play shapes health outcomes through annually updated measures, transparent methods, and accessible data tools. 

CHR&R resources will not be available on countyhealthrankings.org after December 2026. Recognizing the enduring value of these materials, this archive aims to preserve datasets, code, and technical documentation for continued use by public health practitioners, analysts, students, and anyone interested in community health research.

[**County Health Rankings & Roadmaps Zenodo Repositories**](https://zenodo.org/communities/countyhealthrankingsandroadmaps/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest)

-   [Measure calculation codes](https://github.com/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/county_health_measure_calculations): scripts and workflows to calculate most CHR&R measure from the latest annual release
-   Datasets: Versioned releases of CHR&R datasets for each year (2010-2025), each with a DOI for citation and direct download. There are two primary repositories: one contains [human readable Excel files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17584420) and the other contains [relational files with metadata](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18157681)
