## *COMING SUMMER 2026*

### What to expect

View and download state- and county-level data for measures of Population Health and Well-being and Community Conditions based on the UWPHI Model of Population Health. Snapshots are easy to use and don't require data or programming expertise.

### Preview

We’re currently developing this tool, and it is not yet final. For now, you can view a preview below or explore it yourself [here](https://countyhealthrankings.shinyapps.io/snapshot/).

We welcome your help in troubleshooting and improving this tool. You can see planned updates and suggest changes on the [app’s GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/snapshot/issues).

Thank you for your collaboration and stay tuned!
