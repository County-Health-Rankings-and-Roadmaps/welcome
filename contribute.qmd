Thank you for your interest in contributing to the County Health Open Source Project!

## Ways to Contribute
### Measure calculations repository 
The [measure calculations repository](https://github.com/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/county_health_measure_calculations) is the core engine behind CHR&R data. Following funding loss, we especially welcome contributions that help extend calculations beyond 2025/2026. 

#### You can: 
- Add publicly available raw data for years beyond 2025/2026 
- Update calculation scripts to accommodate new data
- Flag broken data sources or links 
- Propose alternative publicly accessible data sources if original sources are no longer available 
- Improve reproducibility, performance, or documentation of workflows 

#### Important context: 

Contributions should prioritize transparency, traceability, and alignment with historical methods 

If methods change due to data availability, clearly document the change and its implications 

We ask that you aim to contribute a measure in its entirety – in other words, if possible, please provide raw data, any necessary inputs, a clearly documented script for completing calculations, and a finalized measure dataset for any measure that you undertake.  

#### How to contribute: 

Start by opening an Issue describing: 
  1) The measure of health   
  2) The data source 
  3) Years covered 
  4) Any deviations from prior methods 

Fork the repository and create a feature branch 

Run calculation scripts locally and validate outputs 

Update documentation to reflect changes 

Submit a pull request with a clear summary and validation notes 

###  Snapshot App 

Contributions to the Snapshot App focus on usability, accuracy, and clarity. 

#### You can: 
- Report bugs (e.g., filters not working, incorrect values, display issues) 
- Suggest usability or accessibility improvements 
- Propose new comparisons, tools, or explanatory text 
- Flag inconsistencies between the app and published data or documentation
