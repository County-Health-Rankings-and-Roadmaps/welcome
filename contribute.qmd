Thank you for your interest in contributing to the County Health Open-Source Project! There are many ways to get involved. Below we've highlighted just some of the ways we invite you to participate.

## Measure calculations repository

The [measure calculations repository](https://github.com/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/county_health_measure_calculations) is the core engine behind CHR&R data. Following funding loss, **we especially welcome contributions that help extend calculations beyond 2025/2026.**

#### You can:

-   Add publicly available raw data for years beyond 2025/2026
-   Update calculation scripts to accommodate new data
-   Flag broken data sources or links
-   Propose alternative publicly accessible data sources if original sources are no longer available
-   Improve reproducibility, performance, or documentation of workflows

#### Important context:

Contributions should prioritize transparency, traceability, and alignment with historical methods

If methods change due to data availability, clearly document the change and its implications

We ask that you aim to contribute a measure in its entirety – in other words, if possible, please provide raw data, any necessary inputs, a clearly documented script for completing calculations, and a finalized measure dataset for any measure that you undertake.

#### How to contribute:

Submissions are reviewed before acceptance. To submit a contribution to the repository:

1.  Start by opening [an Issue](https://github.com/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/county_health_measure_calculations/issues) describing:
    a.  The measure of health
    b.  The data source
    c.  Years covered
    d.  Any deviations from prior methods
2.  Fork the repository and create a feature branch
3.  Run calculation scripts locally and validate outputs
4.  Update documentation to reflect changes
5.  Submit a pull request with a clear summary and notes

## **Archived Data & Documentation** 

[Archived materials](https://zenodo.org/communities/countyhealthrankingsandroadmaps/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest) are intended for reuse, extension, and storytelling. 

You can: 

-   Use archived data to study trends, policy impacts, or health inequities 
-   Combine archived CHR&R data with new data sources 
-   Develop teaching materials, dashboards, or advocacy tools 
-   Share how you are using the data to inform local or regional decision-making 

#### **How to contribute:** 

-   Participate in the [community discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/discussions) 
-   Share projects, analyses, or visualizations in the [Show & Tell section](https://github.com/orgs/County-Health-Rankings-and-Roadmaps/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) 
-   Include links and citations to our archived data wherever possible 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Community Norms** 

-   Be respectful and constructive 
-   Assume good intent 
-   Document decisions and tradeoffs clearly 
-   Prioritize equity, transparency, and public health impact 

**We are especially committed to building an open-source community that is useful with or without deep GitHub or data expertise.** 

Thank you for contributing to the future of county-level health data.
